## Why did I create this web app?

I'm learning to play drums. When learning a new song, I usually play along with the song on YouTube Mobile App. But the original speed of the song might be too fast to follow. I need to slow down the song to the speed which I'm able to play along with, practice and gradually speed up a bit again and again, until I can play along with the song in the original speed.

If you need to control the YouTube video, hope this helps you as well.
